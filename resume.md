## Summary

Experienced engineering leader with a track record of building and scaling large-scale platforms and AI-powered internal systems. I enjoy taking loosely defined problems, finding the right technical approach, and shipping solutions that make entire teams more productive — from RAG knowledge bases and orchestration systems to automated deployment pipelines. I work closely with product, operations, and engineering partners to shape technical direction and raise the bar on how we build software.

## Core Strengths

- Engineering leadership and team growth
- Working across Product, Ops, and Engineering to align on direction
