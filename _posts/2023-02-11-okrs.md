OKRs, or Objectives and Key Results, are a commonly used strategy for engineering organizations to set and measure progress towards their goals. However, getting engineering teams to fully embrace OKRs and put them into practice can be a challenge. One reason is that objectives tend to be too conceptual and disconnected from the day-to-day work of the engineers. They are meant to be inspirational, but often end up being vague and unclear, leading to a lack of engagement from the team.

Senior engineers intuitively know what is needed to evolve the platform, keep the codebase maintainable, and sustain development velocity. This may include reducing complexity, paying down tech debt, or improving developer tooling. By tapping into this expertise and asking the team what initiatives and projects they think are important for the product or platform to be successful, organizations can extract meaningful goals while creating buy-in and ownership among the team.

The first step is to get a big list of initiatives going. The team should include small things like upgrading dependencies, bigger things like building new tools, and even some crazy scary things (ditch React for htmx anyone?). Discuss the impact and cost of each item. The next step is to prioritize and group them into common themes. This helps align everyone around common goals and ensures that the objectives are grounded in practical work. The themes can then be used to form the basis for the objectives.

Finally, by describing a future where the problem that the initiatives are trying to solve is solved, the objective can become inspiring and motivating for the team. This helps ensure that the OKRs are impactful and relevant to the work that the engineers are doing every day.

In conclusion, getting engineering teams to embrace OKRs requires a bottom-up approach that emphasizes the importance of input and alignment with the team's work. By tapping into the expertise of senior engineers and starting with a list of initiatives that the team thinks are important, prioritizing and grouping them into themes, and describing a future where the problem is solved, organizations can create OKRs that are relevant, achievable, and impactful for their engineering teams.
