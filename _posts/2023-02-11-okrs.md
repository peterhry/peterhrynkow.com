OKRs, or Objectives and Key Results, are a commonly used strategy for engineering organizations to set and measure progress towards their goals. However, getting engineering teams to fully embrace OKRs and put them into practice can be a challenge, as objectives tend to be too conceptual and disconnected from the day-to-day work of the engineers. To overcome this, organizations need to adopt a bottom-up approach that emphasizes the importance of input and alignment with the teamâ€™s work.

## Tapping into Expertise

Senior engineers possess valuable expertise on what is needed to evolve the platform, keep the codebase maintainable, and sustain development velocity. By tapping into this expertise and asking the team what initiatives and projects they think are important for the product or platform to be successful, organizations can extract meaningful goals while creating buy-in and ownership among the team.

## Gathering Initiatives

To start, gather a list of initiatives, both big and small, that the team thinks are important. This can include upgrading dependencies, building new tools, and even some bold ideas. Then, prioritize and group the initiatives into common themes, taking into account their impact and cost. 

## Setting Objectives

By grouping initiatives into themes, the team can better see how they fit together and identify areas where multiple initiatives can be tackled in a coordinated manner. The themes can then be used as the basis for the objectives, and by describing a future where the problem that the initiatives are trying to solve is solved, the objectives become inspiring and motivating for the team.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, a bottom-up approach to OKRs in engineering organizations involves tapping into the expertise of senior engineers and gathering a list of initiatives that the team considers important. By prioritizing and grouping these initiatives into themes, organizations can create OKRs that are relevant, achievable, and impactful for their engineering teams. This approach not only increases engagement and buy-in from the team but also helps organizations make better decisions about what initiatives to prioritize and what work to focus on.
