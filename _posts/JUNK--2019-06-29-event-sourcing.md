Schema migrations have been a persistent pain point for our team as we move toward an event-driven architecture. The operational overhead of replaying events from Kafka in order to populate read models in Elasticsearch is tedious, hard to automate, and prone to human-error.

Needless to say, I was intrigued when I came across this talk by David Schmitz (funny guy, btw) that suggests you may not need static read models in some cases. **By creating many smaller event streams (e.g. one per entity), you can get good performance replaying events in realtime.**
